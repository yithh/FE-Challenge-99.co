# React

1. Hide description until the button is clicked

2. Because of SEO we want to only hide description after page load

3. Anonymize all phone numbers: first 4 numbers visible, replace following 4 with X (e.g. 8111 XXXX or 8123 XXXX)
   Note Singapore phone number format is always 8 numbers long.
   See [Number Ranges on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_Singapore#Number_ranges) for precise rules.

4. Line returns (new lines) in the description text should be displayed on page. The text must NOT be all in one line.

5. Clicking on phone number reveals the real number
